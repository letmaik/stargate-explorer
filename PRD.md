# Stargate Explorer (2D Edition) - Product Requirements Document

Step through the Stargate into procedurally generated alien worlds, explore in 2D, avoid dangers, collect artifacts, and find new addresses to continue deeper into the galaxy.

**Experience Qualities**: 
1. **Mysterious** - Each world should feel like an unknown frontier with secrets to uncover
2. **Strategic** - Resource management and careful exploration create meaningful decisions  
3. **Progressive** - Each world introduces new challenges while building on learned mechanics

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Manages multiple game systems (movement, resources, procedural generation) with persistent progress across worlds

## Essential Features

### Stargate Dialing System
- **Functionality**: Select from unlocked gate addresses to travel between worlds
- **Purpose**: Core progression mechanic that gates content and creates exploration goals
- **Trigger**: Player clicks on Stargate ring or address panel 
- **Progression**: View available addresses → Select destination → Confirm travel → Load new world
- **Success criteria**: Player can reliably travel between unlocked worlds and new addresses unlock through exploration

### 2D World Exploration
- **Functionality**: Top-down grid-based movement through procedurally generated alien landscapes
- **Purpose**: Primary gameplay loop of discovery, resource gathering, and puzzle solving
- **Trigger**: Player uses WASD/arrow keys to move through the world
- **Progression**: Move across tiles → Encounter hazards/enemies/artifacts → Navigate to objectives → Find exit gate
- **Success criteria**: Smooth movement, clear tile interactions, visible progress toward world completion

### Resource Management
- **Functionality**: Track supplies consumed during exploration and artifacts collected
- **Purpose**: Creates tension and strategic decision-making in exploration
- **Trigger**: Movement consumes supplies, interacting with artifacts adds to inventory
- **Progression**: Start with limited supplies → Manage consumption during exploration → Find resources or exit before depletion
- **Success criteria**: Clear resource tracking, meaningful scarcity, balanced consumption rates

### Procedural World Generation
- **Functionality**: Generate unique alien worlds with biomes, hazards, enemies, and puzzles
- **Purpose**: Ensures replayability and discovery in each playthrough
- **Trigger**: Entering a new world through the Stargate
- **Progression**: Generate terrain → Place hazards and enemies → Scatter artifacts → Position exit gate
- **Success criteria**: Worlds feel distinct, appropriately challenging, and contain all necessary elements

### Puzzle & Combat Systems
- **Functionality**: Symbol-based puzzles in ruins and enemy avoidance/combat mechanics
- **Purpose**: Provides skill-based challenges beyond resource management
- **Trigger**: Player interacts with ruin structures or encounters patrolling enemies
- **Progression**: Encounter challenge → Use skills/resources to overcome → Gain rewards → Continue exploration
- **Success criteria**: Puzzles are solvable with logical deduction, combat feels fair and strategic

## Edge Case Handling

- **Resource Depletion**: Game over screen with restart option if supplies reach zero before finding exit
- **Stuck in World**: Ensure each generated world has guaranteed path to exit gate and sufficient resources
- **Address Fragments**: Clear indication when enough fragments are collected to unlock new addresses
- **Enemy Pathfinding**: Enemies handle obstacles and don't get stuck in terrain
- **Save State Corruption**: Graceful fallback to starting state if saved progress becomes invalid

## Design Direction

The design should evoke the wonder and danger of exploring ancient alien civilizations - mysterious yet approachable, with clean sci-fi aesthetics that emphasize the unknown. Minimal interface allows focus on exploration while providing clear information about critical resources and progress.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme using deep space blues, ancient gold, and alien green to create otherworldly atmosphere while maintaining good contrast.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Space Blue (oklch(0.25 0.15 250)) - Communicates the vast unknown and space travel
- **Secondary Colors**: Stargate Silver (oklch(0.75 0.05 250)) for UI elements, Ancient Stone (oklch(0.45 0.08 80)) for ruins
- **Accent Color**: Energy Gold (oklch(0.75 0.18 85)) - Attention-grabbing highlight for active gates, collected artifacts, and important UI elements
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Deep Blue #0A1628): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 12.6:1 ✓
  - Card (Stone Gray #2D3748): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 8.9:1 ✓
  - Primary (Space Blue #2563EB): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 5.2:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Silver #94A3B8): Dark text (#1A202C) - Ratio 8.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Energy Gold #F59E0B): Dark text (#1A202C) - Ratio 7.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should feel both futuristic and ancient, suggesting advanced alien technology discovered by human explorers. Clean sans-serif with distinctive character shapes for readability at small sizes during exploration.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Game Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (World Names): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (UI Labels): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Game Text): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed spacing
  - Small (Resource Counters): Inter Medium/14px/tight spacing

## Animations

Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance the sense of advanced alien technology without distracting from strategic gameplay. Motion should feel precise and technological.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Gate activation sequences create ceremony around world travel, tile highlighting guides movement, resource depletion creates urgency
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Gate sequences are most prominent, followed by player movement feedback, then ambient environmental effects

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Card for world selection and inventory, Button for gate activation, Progress for resource tracking, Dialog for puzzles, Alert for game over states
- **Customizations**: Custom grid system for world maps, specialized Stargate ring component, alien glyph symbols for addresses
- **States**: Buttons show clear hover/active states for gate controls, tiles provide immediate feedback for valid moves, resource bars change color approaching depletion
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for UI (House for home, Compass for exploration, Battery for supplies), custom alien glyphs for gate addresses
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4px/8px/16px grid for tight UI density, 24px margins for breathing room around major sections
- **Mobile**: Stack gate controls vertically on mobile, simplified touch controls for movement, larger hit targets for small screen interaction
